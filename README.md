I am a README.

"My name is Brandon Fryer and this is my ever evolving repository containing my nightly lessons, projects, and practices. I am begining my journey into Web Development and this web app is the most recent manifestation of that journey. Also, this is my first time working with a framework/library!

Plans for the app are as follows:

The HOME page will be a working chronological blog containing posts and links to my projects.

In the PORTFOLIO section, you will be able to navigate these projects more freely.

In the ABOUT section, you can learn a bit about who I am, as well as, see some of my favorite family photos.

Lastly, a CONTACT page to get in touch!"

Thanks for reading me.
